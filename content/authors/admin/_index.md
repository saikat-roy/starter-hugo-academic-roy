I﻿ am a doctoral researcher working at the [Division of Medical Image Computing ](https://www.dkfz.de/en/mic/index.php) at the [German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html). My work focuses on the development of Deep Learning techniques for medical image segmentation. The technical focus of my research is on the usage of Transformer architectures.

I﻿ have previously worked at the Deep Medical Imaging Lab at German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) exploring deep learning for the segmentation of neuroanatomy.
